    "The radiative transfer model of a disk can be dependent on the inclination of the disk relative to the observer's line of sight. In the previous tutorial, the initial model was face-on, and *SIMIO* later modified the geometry (inclination and position angle), which is only correct if we assume that the changes in inclination will conserve the flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to change individual geometrical parameters or change none. In this tutorial, we want to compare a disk from Garate et al. (subm.) with Elias 24 without changing the inclination but modifying the position angle.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model of the disk was generated with the same inclination of Elias 24 and with a semi-major axis along the x-axis. We would like to have the disk with the same position angle as Elias 24."
