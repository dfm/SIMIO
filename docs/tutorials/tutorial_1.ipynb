    "One key question to connect the origin of our Solar System to the general understanding of the planet-formation field is to estimate **how would the Solar System have looked like if it had been observed by ALMA**. In ([Bergez-Casalou et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...659A...6B/abstract)), hydro-models were complemented with dust evolution models to answer this question.\n",

The following figure shows such prediction, with each line showing the approximate orbit position of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, from the inside out, respectively:"
