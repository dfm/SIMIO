    "## Templates are the base of SIMIO\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a new observation from scratch, SIMIO takes existing observations and replaces the data with the visibilities of a given model. By doing so, the synthetic observation of the input model will have the same visibility coverage of the template. In practice, it is as if your model had been positioned in the sky at the same coordinates of the real observation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Generating a synthetic observation\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to replace the template visibilities with the input model visibilities are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A *SIMIO* object is created: By using the class simio_object you set all the details for the synthetic observation. Here your object will get all the technical details of the selected template, and other observable parameters will be set too, such geometry modifications, distance of the observation, observed flux. You can check examples of how to modify each one of those values in the Tutorials section.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Generate synthetic observation: A synthetic observation is created based on the template chosen for the *simio_object*. To do this, the next steps are followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) An empty image is created with *tclean* using the template observational details, and with the same pixel size and image size as the input model. The input model values are then copied into this empty image, which has the CASA format of an *image.model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) If a geometry change is needed, the uv-points of the template will be projected with the requested inclination and position angle. The Fourier Transform will be calculated over this new set of uv-points, thus avoiding modifying the image to apply a geometry modification. After that, the uv-points are deprojected with the same inclination and position angle, therefore returning to their original position, but effectively having measured the Fourier Transform of the *image.model* in the projected space.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c) The Fourier transform of the *image.model* is written into the synthetic observation, which is a copy of the template observation. This is done for every spectral window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imaging a synthetic observation\n",
    "\n",
    "The image reconstruction of the synthetic observation can be done within *SIMIO* using the function *easy_mod_tclean*. This function was designed such that people who are not familiar with CASA or ALMA data can generate their own images as easily as possible. Just tell *easy_mod_tclean* what is the *simio_object* to be imaged, set a stopping threshold if needed, and get your images done.\n"
