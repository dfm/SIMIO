    "For a discussion about the input image size and the assumptions for a correct Fourier Transform calculation, we refer you to [Tazzari et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.4527T/abstract). In short, smaller pixel size and larger image size are always better. For each template, aim to have a pixel size about $\\times6\\sim10$ times smaller than the angular resolution, and image sizes larger than $\\times6\\sim10''$. For optimal results, generate a different image to generate observations at different distances."
