SIMIO-continuum - SIMulatIons to Observations
===============================

*SIMIO-continuum* is a collection of codes designed to help you compare
your radiative transfer images with existing ALMA observations. With 
*SIMIO-continuum* you can generate your synthetic observations with
different geometries, distances, and even including white noise.

Please check www.nicolaskurtovic.com/simio and the Contents section
for a detailed description of the package. Although *SIMIO-continuum*
is the official name, this page uses *SIMIO-continuum* or *SIMIO*
