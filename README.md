# Get Started

This git-hub repository just contains the codes to run =SIMIO=, but it does not include the example "Solar System to HD163296" project, and it does not contain the templates either. You can download the templates from www.nicokurtovic.com/SIMIO/templates, and the example project can be downloaded by clicking on the following section:


# Example: Solar System to HD163296

How would the Solar System have looked if it was located where the HD163296 system is, and it had been observed by ALMA as part of the DSHARP project?

Click here to download this example project: [SolarS_HD163296.tar.gz](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/03e64c2d3f524c219a99/) (163.6 MB)\

After downloading it, untar it in the projects folder, such that the directories have the following order: /path_to_SIMIO/SIMIO/projects/SolarS_HD163296/ .
