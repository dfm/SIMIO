# SIMIO: from SIMulatIons to Observations
SIMIO is a collection of codes designed to help you compare your radiative transfer images with existing ALMA observations. Please check www.nicokurtovic.com/SIMIO for a full description of the package.

# Get Started

This git-hub repository just contains the codes to run SIMIO, but it does not include the example "Solar System to HD163296" project, and it does not contain the templates either. You can download the templates from www.nicokurtovic.com/SIMIO/templates, and the example project can be downloaded by clicking on the following section:


# Example: Solar System to HD163296

How would the Solar System have looked if it was located where the HD163296 system is, and it had been observed by ALMA as part of the DSHARP project?
